# devkits-redisigned
this repo has me using common devkits for offensive and defensive cybersecurity purposes

The code published in this repo is from my private collection. I'm not a great programmer but I act so if you find any errors feel free to create an issue or pull request.

 #kits used include;
 
   * #Arduino uno with ESP8266 module and couple of sensors (currently censors code not public)
    
   * #ATMEL SAMD 21 Explained pro with WINC 1500 module and some sp module
    
this one has few issues but the idea is have it with a macaddress whitelist and mockup security system when security system is on simulating everyone has left and only the necessary connected devices are left any new connection is kicked out of the network. Also tracks for deauth packets going to the network. still buggy hence not public yet. not soon as i'm quite held up.
    
currently only common and basic code uploading and grows with time.
